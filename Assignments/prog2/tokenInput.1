Hi there how are you?
echo "Please do not" try this at home/
echo "Will this 'work?"
echo 'How about this one?'
ls foo.c foo.* *.bar *,x,2
find . -name "*.c" -mtime +2
let    us"now try some tricky ones"like		this			   one.
what	about an "error like a bad matching end quote'?
or	'how    about'    this one    'which also is wrong"?
or   how  about 'this    one'that    lacks "the    space"we need but'not here' done....
